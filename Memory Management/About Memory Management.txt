C++ allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run time. This is known as dynamic memory allocation.

In other programming languages such as Java and Python, the compiler automatically manages the memories allocated to variables. But this is not the case in C++.

In C++, we need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory manually after we have no use for the variable.

We can allocate and then deallocate memory dynamically using the new and delete operators respectively.
